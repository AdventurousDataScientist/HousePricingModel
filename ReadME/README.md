This notebook is for my first submission into the Kaggle House Prices Competition. 

This is just a benchmark model, where I do some data cleaning and data manipulation, the bulk of the focus here is on hyper parameter tuning.

Target Variable Distribution

Raw Target Variable Distribution

This is the raw distribution of the sale price variable.

This is the binned distribution of the sale price variable, just to get a better understanding of how the variable looks.
I grouped the variable into 4 different groups: 

* 0 - 100,000
* 100,000 - 200,000
* 200,000 - 300,000
* 300,000+
